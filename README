FedCoRE – Effective Federated Learning for Constrained RESTful Environments in the AIoT
📜 Overview

FedCoRE is a practical Federated Learning (FL) framework designed for resource-constrained IoT devices in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) environments. It leverages standards for constrained RESTful environments, such as the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), to optimize communication, and uses model quantization to address computation and storage limitations.

FedCoRE has been implemented and tested on devices with 256 KB of RAM, achieving significant reductions in communication costs while maintaining model accuracy.

This repository contains the codebase and tool-chain developed as part of the FedCoRE project, organized into:

    Centralized Training – Baseline training and evaluation of models in a non-federated setting.
    Federated Training – Implementation of FedCoRE and standard FL pipelines.
    Dataset – Data preparation scripts and raw datasets used in experiments.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Install required dependencies using the provided installation scripts in each sub-directory.
    Some experiments require CoAP libraries and embedded device toolchains (instructions will be added soon).

Each sub-directory contains its own README file with detailed execution instructions.
⚙️ How to Run
1. Centralized Training

Navigate to the centralized_training directory and follow its README instructions to reproduce baseline results.
2. Federated Training (FedCoRE)

Navigate to the federated_training directory and follow its README to run FedCoRE on the target dataset.
📂 Codebase Notes

    The centralized and federated training modules are independent but share a similar data pipeline.
    Model configurations, hyperparameters, and training options are customizable in each module.
    The FedCoRE implementation supports model quantization, communication compression, and CoAP-based messaging for deployment on constrained IoT devices.
